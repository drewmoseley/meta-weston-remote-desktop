This README file contains information on the contents of the meta-weston-remote-desktop layer.

Dependencies

  This layer has been built to work with the Toradex BSP 7.x.y release:

I. Adding the meta-weston-remote-desktop layer to your build
============================================================

  I. Setup a proper build using the Toradex instructions linked above.  Make sure to build the tdx-reference-multimedia-image.
  II. Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer <path-to>/meta-weston-remote-desktop'
  III. Rebuild the tdx-reference-multimedia-image.

II. Configuring Remote Desktop
==============================

Currently this layer supports two methods of graphical display sharing; vnc and rdp, both using a virtual display. To select
the desired mode, modify the target file "/etc/default/weston".  This can be done directly on the target, or on the build
system by modifying the `recipes-graphics/wayland/weston-init.bbappend` file.  Valid values for the "WESTON_MODE" variable are:
  * vnc-virtual
  * rdp-virtual
  * <empty> (which will run the standard DRM-based backend)

Additional configuration, such as screen size, can be done by editing the `weston-*.ini` files either on the device
in the `/etc/xdg/weston` directory or as part of the build in the `recipes-graphics/wayland/files` directory.
